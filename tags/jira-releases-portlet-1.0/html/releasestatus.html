<h4>Screenshots</h4>
<p>To get you salivating, here's a happy project which is very close to release: </p>

<p>and here's a project that is in its early days and still creating new issues: </p>

<h4>The secret to happiness</h4>
<p>Obviously you're all wondering what makes happiness. How does one tell the health of a project. What secret bit of wizardry and hours of cpu-intensive magic is this portlet doing???</p>
<p>Fortunately, here at CBA Industries we decided to take the simple approach to happiness. It's simply: "If the project continues to maintain the velocity of the last 7 days, will it hit its release date?". Nothing fancy, nothing special and something to be taken with a LOT of salt. </p>
