<h4>About the plugin</h4>
<p>The portlet provided by the Current User Status plugin can be considered an entry point into the user's profile, and a replacement for the Quick Links and In Progress portlets. It's expected to be of use in every JIRA, bringing many different pieces of data and links into a concise piece of screen real estate. </p>
<p>Version 1.0.2 was released on 30th of June 2007. It adds an icon for assigned open issues as that can often be a small part of the percentage bar. </p>
<p>Version 1.0.1 was released on 19th of April 2007. It fixed a bug whereby the green/red links on the percentage bars were back to front. </p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released on 10th of April 2007. </p>
