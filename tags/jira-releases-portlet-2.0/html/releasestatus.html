<h4>About the plugin</h4>
<p>A plugin that provides three portlets. 
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first is a portlet for the JIRA dashboard that provides a status for a particular version. </p>
<p>Its expected use case is for highlighting the next release of the major product(s) via a feature-list of: </p>
<ul>
<li>Handy stats on the activity in the last week</li>
<li>Useful stats for due-date management</li>
<li>Information on how close the project is to release</li>
<li>Release health - will your last week's velocity see you hitting your release date</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The second portlet lets you show the last N releases. Its expected to be of use to large JIRAs with many releases. </p></li>
<li><p>The third is a project panel that makes it easy to see the release history of a project. Its expected to be of use to projects that have had with many releases. </p></li>
</ol>
<p>Version 2.0 was released on 17th of March 2007. It added the latest releases portlet and the releases project panel. </p>
<p>Version 1.0 was released on 16th of March 2007. It just contained the releast status portlet. </p>

<h4>Screenshots</h4>

<h4>The secret to happiness</h4>
<p>Obviously you're all wondering what makes happiness. How does one tell the health of a project. What secret bit of wizardry and hours of cpu-intensive magic is this portlet doing???</p>
<p>Fortunately, here at CBA Industries we decided to take the simple approach to happiness. It's simply: "If the project continues to maintain the velocity of the last 7 days, will it hit its release date?". Nothing fancy, nothing special and something to be taken with a LOT of salt. </p>
