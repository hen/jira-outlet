<title>[RRR-16] Writer vs OutputStream</title>
<link>http://issues.osjava.org/jira/browse/RRR-16</link>

                    <description>When rendering, should it be to an OutputStream or to a Writer?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Excel and images will need an OutputStream. Is there any reason to keep a Writer for the others? They can always use an OutputStreamWriter to get around things.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So seems to me....the system should switch to being OutputStream based and not Writer based.</description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Possibly an AbstractBinaryRenderer class should exist to stop people using the Writer from the other one. Shame you can&apos;t make a method abstract that a super class already defines.</comment>
