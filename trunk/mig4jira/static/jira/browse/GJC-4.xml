<title>[GJC-4] Create genjava-xmlparser and genjava-props</title>
<link>http://issues.osjava.org/jira/browse/GJC-4</link>

                    <description>I&apos;d like to take the properties implementations out of the simple-jndi setup. &lt;br/&gt;
I&apos;d then like to make them their own jar, though would also need the XML parser as its own jar again.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So idea is to experiment with lots of small jars. Now that I&apos;m better at handling releases etc. genjava-core would become a multi-project, so would need some maven learning there.</description>

&lt;br/&gt;
Also worth removing is the beans package and the random package. All the proxy stuff together. Unsure what the name would be. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The jdbc package really ought to die in favour of dbutils.&lt;br/&gt;
io stuff needs to go in various directions. &lt;br/&gt;
math be folded into lang? or just folded?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Mailer should go into its own piece. Would need some more work then. </comment>
