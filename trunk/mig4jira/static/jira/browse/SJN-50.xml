&lt;br/&gt;
Possibly Dave&apos;s Bunny project might have investigated  how to abstract factory concepts in a persisted String based system.</comment>

Possibly rename type subvariable to #type. Avoids clashes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The #converter subvariable would specify a Converter class [interface in simple-jndi] which would have   Object convert(String). &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The default converter would exist and be some of the code destined to be in HierarchicalMap.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Is there a way to plug in a converter for the List that is created when a set of values are created?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
Is #type compatible with other systems? Would it have the .? Seems no point. age#type age#converter.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
The type needs to be on the higher up HierarchicalMap. So:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
foo.blah.url=&lt;br/&gt;
foo.blah.password=&lt;br/&gt;
foo.blah.driver=&lt;br/&gt;
foo.blah.user=&lt;br/&gt;
foo.blah#type=javax.sql.DataSource&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
and it is given a Map of values.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
So should be possible to implement the type=DataSource as a #converter too. Hardcoded.</comment>
