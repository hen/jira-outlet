<title>[SJN-39] XML does not work well if at all in the 0.6 release.</title>
<link>http://issues.osjava.org/jira/browse/SJN-39</link>

                    <description>Lorrin Nelson has pointed out problems in the XmlProperties loading code. I suspect it did work for whatever example I was based on, but not for other variants.</description>

More testing is required.</comment>

&lt;br/&gt;
This makes DataStores a bit hard to set up as they need the org flag to say what their type is. Moving to a generic type system might help here, but it would mean _type being a special sub-element or something.</comment>

DataSources are now implemented as a type attribute or sub-tag which seems to work nicely.</comment>
